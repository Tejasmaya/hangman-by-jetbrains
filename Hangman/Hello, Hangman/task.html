<p>Hangman is a popular, funny, yet very grim game. A cruel computer hides a word from you and you need to guess it, letter by letter. If you fail, you'll be hanged, if you win, you'll survive.</p>
<p>You're probably familiar with the rules; now you can create this game yourself!</p>
<p>Let's take a brief look at what you are going to build in this project. Here is what the gameplay will look like:</p>
<ul>
<li>In the main menu, players can choose to either play or exit the game;</li>
<li>If players choose to play, the computer picks a word from a list — it will be the answer;</li>
<li>The computer asks players to enter a letter that may or may not be in the word;</li>
<li>If players suggest a letter that does not appear in the word for the first time, It's a miss. A player can miss 8 times before the game is over;</li>
<li>If the letter does occur in the word, the computer notifies the players. If there are letters left to guess, the computer invites the player to go on;</li>
<li>When the entire word is uncovered — it's a victory! The game should calculate the final score and return to the main menu.</li>
</ul>
<p>This may sound complex, but the project is split into small stages with the hints that will guide you. We guarantee that the final product is replayable and quite engaging!</p>
<p>Let's start with an announcement that will greet the player. You already know how to print with Python. Apply that knowledge to entice your friends to play with an announcement for your game!</p>
