<html><body><h5 id="description">Description</h5>
<p>If there is only one word, the game becomes dull. You already know the word, and thereâ€™s no challenge. In this stage, let's make the game more difficult by choosing a word from the special list with a variety of options. This way, our game gains in replayability.</p>
<h5 id="objectives">Objectives</h5>
<ul>
<li>Create the following list of words: <code class="java">python</code>, <code class="java">java</code>, <code class="java">swift</code>, <code class="java">javascript</code>;</li>
<li>Program the game to choose a word from the list at random (you can use the <code class="java">random</code> library for that). You can enter more words, but let's stick to these four for now.</li>
</ul>
<h5 id="examples">Examples</h5>
<p>The greater-than symbol followed by a space (<code class="java">&gt; </code>) represents the user input. Note that it's not part of the input.</p>
<p><strong>Example 1</strong>: <em>computer chooses python from the list.</em></p>
<pre><code class="language-no-highlight">H A N G M A N
Guess the word: &gt; python
You survived!</code></pre>
<p><strong>Example 2</strong>:<strong> </strong><em>computer chooses something other than python from the list.</em></p>
<pre><code class="language-no-highlight">H A N G M A N
Guess the word: &gt; python
You lost!</code></pre>
<p><strong>Example 3</strong>:<strong> </strong><em>computer randomly chooses something other than swift from the list.</em></p>
<pre><code class="language-no-highlight">H A N G M A N
Guess the word: &gt; swift
You lost!</code></pre></body></html>
