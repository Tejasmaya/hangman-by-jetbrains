<p>The skeleton of the game is ready; let's put some more gameplay meat on it.</p>
<p>In the previous stage, if players entered the same letter twice or more, the program reduced the number of remaining attempts regardless of whether this was a correct letter or not. This doesnâ€™t seem fair, right? Players gain nothing, and the number of attempts gets smaller. Let's fix it!</p>
<h5 id="objectives">Objectives</h5>
<p>To complete this stage, follow the suggested order of the required checks:</p>
<ul>
<li>Check whether players enter exactly one letter. If not, print <code class="java">Please, input a single letter.</code>. Remember that when players input nothing or non-letter characters, it shouldn't count as a correct input either;</li>
<li>Make sure that the player entered a lowercase English letter. If not, the program should print <code class="java">Please, enter a lowercase letter from the English alphabet.</code>;</li>
<li>If users enter the same letter twice (doesn't matter whether it appears in the word or not), then the program should output <code class="java">You've already guessed this letter.</code>. Do not decrease the number of attempts in this case;</li>
<li>None of the three errors described above should reduce the number of remaining attempts!</li>
<li>When players win, print <code class="java">You guessed the word &lt;word&gt;!</code>, where <code class="java">&lt;word&gt;</code> should be substituted with the uncovered word, and the winning message. Each one should be on a new line.</li>
</ul>
<p></p><div class="alert alert-warning">Please, make sure that the output format of your program follows the example precisely. Pay attention to the empty lines between attempts and at the end.</div><p></p>
<h5 id="examples">Examples</h5>
<p>The greater-than symbol followed by a space (<code class="java">&gt; </code>) represents the user input. Note that it's not part of the input.  Comments after <code class="java">#</code> provided for illustrative purposes and not as part of the task.</p>
