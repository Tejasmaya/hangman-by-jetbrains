<html><body><h5 id="description">Description</h5>
<p>So far, our game has been some kind of a draft; we still lack a way to handle the player's victory. The player has only eight attempts, and the number of remaining attempts decreases every turn, even if players guess them correctly.</p>
<p>In this stage, we will start reducing the attempts only after players make a mistake. They can be mistaken eight times: attempts are reduced if the suggested letter is not in the word or if it has already been suggested before (no matter whether it's been a correct one or not). If a player has guessed all the letters, they win. If a player has some attempts after guessing the word, discard them, notify the player, and terminate the game.</p>
<h5 id="objectives">Objectives</h5>
<p>Players start the game with eight lives. In other words, they can make a mistake only eight times.</p>
<ul>
<li>When players input a valid letter, uncover it in the word, and carry on;</li>
<li>Print <code class="java">That letter doesn't appear in the word.</code> and reduce the number of attempts if the word doesn't contain the letter, even if this particular letter has already been suggested before;</li>
<li>Print <code class="java">No improvements.</code> and reduce the attempt' counter when players input a letter that has been successfully uncovered before;</li>
<li>When players win, print the uncovered word, <code class="java">You guessed the word!</code> , and the winning message. Each one should be on a new line.</li>
</ul>
<p></p><div class="alert alert-warning">Please, make sure that the output format of your program follows the example precisely. Pay attention to the empty lines between attempts and at the end.</div><p></p>
