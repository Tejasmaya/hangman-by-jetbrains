<html><body><h5 id="description">Description</h5>
<p>Let's make the game iterative. In this stage, we'll adjust our game to resemble the classic version of Hangman. Players should now guess the letters in a word instead of inputting an entire word. If an attempt is successful, uncover the letter. We also need to add the lose condition — players have eight attempts to guess all letters that appear in the word. When players run out of attempts, the game ends.</p>
<p>Don't forget to get rid of the hints: replace all the letters in a word with hyphens at the beginning. Players input one lowercase letter at a time, so there is no need to worry about that.</p>
<p>Later on, we will also determine the win conditions, but in this stage, let's just see how well our player guesses the word on each attempt.</p>
<h5 id="objectives">Objectives</h5>
<p>Your game should work as follows:</p>
<ul>
<li>Players have exactly eight attempts to guess the word by entering letters one by one. Asking for a letter, print: <code class="java">Input a letter:</code>.<span style="color: #ff4363;"><strong> </strong></span>If a player uncovered all the letters, but some attempts are still left, the program must continue to ask for input until all the tries are exhausted;</li>
<li>If the letter doesn't appear in the word, the computer takes one try away – even if a user has already suggested this letter – and prints <code class="java">That letter doesn't appear in the word.</code>;</li>
<li>If the letter does appear in the word but a user has already suggested this letter and it's open, no need to print any messages;</li>
<li>If all attempts are exhausted, the game ends; the program shows a final message (<code class="java">Thanks for playing!</code>). Otherwise, players can continue to input letters;</li>
<li>We continue to stick with the word list from the previous stage: <code class="java">python</code>, <code class="java">java</code>, <code class="java">swift</code>, <code class="java">javascript</code>. It ensures that your program is tested reliably. Don't worry about <code class="java">javascript</code>. Yes, it's longer than 8 characters, but we'll keep it in the list for consistency since we're not done with developing the game yet and for now there is no win or lose.</li>
</ul>

<p>The greater-than symbol followed by a space (<code class="java">&gt; </code>) represents the user input. Note that it's not part of the input.  Comments after <code class="java">#</code> provided for illustrative purposes and not as part of the task.</p>
<p><strong>Example 1</strong>:</p>
<pre><code class="language-no-highlight">H A N G M A N  # 8 attempts

----------
Input a letter: &gt; a  # 7 attempts

-a-a------
Input a letter: &gt; i  # 6 attempts

-a-a---i--
Input a letter: &gt; o
That letter doesn't appear in the word.  # 5 attempts

-a-a---i--
Input a letter: &gt; z
That letter doesn't appear in the word.  # 4 attempts

-a-a---i--
Input a letter: &gt; l
That letter doesn't appear in the word.  # 3 attempts

-a-a---i--
Input a letter: &gt; p  # 2 attempts

-a-a---ip-
Input a letter: &gt; h
That letter doesn't appear in the word.  # 1 attempt

-a-a---ip-
Input a letter: &gt; k
That letter doesn't appear in the word.  # 0 attempts
