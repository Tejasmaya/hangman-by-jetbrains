<p>In this stage, let's add a little more flavor to the game by constructing a menu to restart the program after the current session ends.</p>
<h5 id="objectives">Objectives</h5>
<ul>
<li>The game now starts with the menu where players can choose to either play, see their score, or exit;</li>
<li>Print <code class="java">Type "play" to play the game, "results" to show the scoreboard, and "exit" to quit:</code> and show this message again if players input something else;</li>
<li>If players choose <code class="java">play</code>, start the game. When the game is finished (regardless of whether a player wins or not), pop up the menu once again to make the gameplay seamless;</li>
<li>If players choose <code class="java">results</code>, print how many games they won, e.g. <code class="java">You won: 0 times</code>, and how many games they lost, e.g. <code class="java">You lost: 25 times</code>;</li>
<li>If players choose <code class="java">exit</code>, end the game.</li>
</ul>
<p></p><div class="alert alert-warning">Please, make sure that the output format of your program follows the example precisely. Pay attention to the empty lines between attempts and at the end.</div><p></p>
<h5 id="example">Example</h5>
<p>The greater-than symbol followed by a space (<code class="java">&gt; </code>) represents the user input. Note that it's not part of the input.  Comments after <code class="java">#</code> provided for illustrative purposes and not as part of the task.</p>
